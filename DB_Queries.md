1. What query would you run to get all the countries that speak Slovene? Your query should return the name of the country, language and language percentage. Your query should arrange the result by language percentage in descending order.
SELECT countries.name, languages.language, languages.percentage FROM countries JOIN languages ON countries.id = languages.country_id WHERE languages.language = "Slovene" ORDER BY languages.percentage DESC;
